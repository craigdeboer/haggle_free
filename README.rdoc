HAGGLE FREE

Ruby Version: 2.2
Rails Version: 4.2

Haggle Free is an application used to buy and sell merchandise.

It's similar to Craigslist and Used Victoria but it allows sellers to use auctions to sell their merchandise. Sellers can choose to use a standard blind auction or they can choose to sell using a Dutch auction where the price is decreased until a buyer is found.
